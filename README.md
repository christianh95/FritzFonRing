# FritzFonRing

Idea is originally from https://www.administrator.de/wissen/informationen-webinterface-fritzbox-shellscript-auslesen-214598.html, but due to some changes of the Web-Interface of FritzBox, I adapted the script in many places.

Password and username have to be configured of course, username only if necessairy.
